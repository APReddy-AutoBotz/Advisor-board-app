**üéØ DIRECT ANSWER: Millets are SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER than white rice for diabetic patients.**

**üìä SCIENTIFIC COMPARISON:**

**Glycemic Index Analysis:**
- **White Rice**: GI 73-89 (HIGH) - causes rapid blood sugar spikes
- **Millets**: GI 54-68 (MODERATE) - provides steady glucose release
- **Impact**: 25-35% lower glucose response with millets

**Nutritional Superiority of Millets:**
- **Fiber**: 8-12g per cup vs 0.6g in white rice (1300% more fiber!)
- **Protein**: 6-11g vs 4g in white rice
- **Magnesium**: 114mg vs 19mg (crucial for insulin function)
- **Chromium**: Higher levels (improves insulin sensitivity)

**ü•á BEST MILLET VARIETIES FOR DIABETICS:**

1. **Foxtail Millet** (Lowest GI: 54)
   - Best for blood sugar control
   - Rich in antioxidants

2. **Pearl Millet** (GI: 67)
   - High protein content
   - Excellent satiety factor

3. **Finger Millet/Ragi** (GI: 57)
   - Highest calcium content
   - Rich in amino acids

**‚ö° IMMEDIATE BENEFITS OF SWITCHING:**
- 30-40% reduction in post-meal glucose spikes
- Better insulin sensitivity within 2-3 weeks
- Improved satiety and weight management
- Enhanced mineral absorption

**üçΩÔ∏è PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Replace white rice completely with millets
- Start with 1:1 ratio, adjust to taste
- Cook millets like rice (2:1 water ratio)
- Combine with vegetables and protein for optimal effect

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:**
- Gradual transition over 1-2 weeks to avoid digestive adjustment
- Monitor blood glucose during transition
- Maintain portion control (3/4 cup cooked millet per meal)

**üî¨ NATUROPATHIC PERSPECTIVE:**
Millets are "functional foods" that work as medicine. They don't just provide nutrition - they actively help regulate blood sugar through their unique fiber matrix and mineral profile.

*This recommendation is based on extensive research and clinical experience. Always coordinate with your healthcare team for personalized diabetes management.*`;

    return `From my ${advisor.role} perspective on rice vs millets for diabetic patients:

**üéØ TCM ANSWER: Millets are SUPERIOR to white rice for diabetes (Xiao Ke syndrome).**

**üèÆ TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE ANALYSIS:**

**Food Energetics Comparison:**
- **White Rice**: Sweet, neutral, but creates DAMPNESS when excessive
- **Millets**: Sweet, neutral, STRENGTHENS Spleen Qi without dampness
- **TCM Verdict**: Millets support organ harmony, rice can worsen diabetes patterns

**üìö TCM UNDERSTANDING OF DIABETES (Xiao Ke):**
- **Root Cause**: Kidney Yin deficiency + Spleen Qi deficiency + Internal Heat
- **White Rice Effect**: Increases dampness, burdens Spleen, worsens Qi stagnation
- **Millet Effect**: Nourishes Spleen, regulates Middle Jiao, harmonizes digestion

**üåæ MILLET VARIETIES & TCM PROPERTIES:**

1. **Foxtail Millet (Su Mi)** 
   - **Nature**: Slightly cool, sweet
   - **Meridians**: Spleen, Stomach, Kidney
   - **Action**: Clears Heat, nourishes Yin, regulates blood sugar

2. **Pearl Millet (Zhu Mi)**
   - **Nature**: Neutral, sweet
   - **Meridians**: Spleen, Lung
   - **Action**: Strengthens Spleen Qi, transforms dampness

3. **Finger Millet (Shou Zhi Su)**
   - **Nature**: Warm, sweet
   - **Meridians**: Spleen, Kidney
   - **Action**: Tonifies Kidney Yang, strengthens bones

**‚öñÔ∏è CONSTITUTIONAL APPROACH:**

**For Yin Deficiency Type** (night sweats, dry mouth, thirst):
- Choose **Foxtail Millet** - cooling nature balances internal heat
- Combine with moistening foods: lily bulbs, tremella mushroom

**For Qi Deficiency Type** (fatigue, poor digestion, loose stools):
- Choose **Pearl Millet** - strengthens Spleen without creating dampness
- Combine with Qi-tonifying foods: Chinese yam, lotus seeds

**For Yang Deficiency Type** (cold limbs, frequent urination):
- Choose **Finger Millet** - gentle warming supports Kidney Yang
- Combine with warming foods: ginger, cinnamon, walnuts

**üç≤ TCM THERAPEUTIC MEAL SUGGESTIONS:**

**Morning**: Foxtail millet congee with goji berries and walnuts
**Lunch**: Pearl millet with bitter melon and lean protein  
**Dinner**: Finger millet with black beans and steamed vegetables

**üåø HERBAL FOOD COMBINATIONS:**
- Millet + Bitter Melon = Clears Heat, regulates blood sugar
- Millet + Mung Beans = Drains dampness, cools internal heat
- Millet + Chinese Yam = Strengthens Spleen, nourishes Kidney

**üìà EXPECTED TCM OUTCOMES:**
- Improved Spleen Qi within 2-3 weeks
- Better blood sugar regulation through organ harmony
- Reduced internal heat and dampness patterns
- Enhanced overall constitutional balance

**‚ö†Ô∏è TCM CAUTIONS:**
- Avoid cold/raw foods with millets (damages Spleen Yang)
- Eat warm, cooked millets for optimal digestion
- Combine with appropriate herbs based on individual constitution

*This TCM analysis integrates traditional wisdom with modern understanding. Consult qualified TCM practitioners for personalized herbal formulas.*`;
