# Avatar Portrait Final Fix - SOLVED!

## Root Cause Identified âœ…

The issue was **NOT** in the board definitions or conversion logic. The problem was in the `AIAdvisorCard` component, which was completely ignoring the `advisor.avatar` field and instead using the `PortraitAssignmentEngine` to generate portraits dynamically.

## The Real Problem

1. **Board definitions were correct** - All avatars were properly assigned to unique portraits
2. **Conversion logic was correct** - `PremiumBoardPicker` properly mapped `expert.avatar` to `advisor.avatar`
3. **AIAdvisorCard was the culprit** - It was using `portraitAssignment.url` instead of `advisor.avatar`

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Fixed AIAdvisorCard Portrait Logic
**File**: `src/components/advisors/AIAdvisorCard.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
const portraitAssignment: PortraitAssignment = portraitEngine.assignPortrait(
  genderPref,
  advisor.id,
  generatedName.firstName,
  generatedName.lastName
);
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Use advisor.avatar if available, otherwise use portrait assignment engine
const portraitAssignment: PortraitAssignment = advisor.avatar 
  ? {
      portraitKey: `custom-${advisor.id}`,
      url: advisor.avatar,
      alt: `Portrait of ${advisor.name} (AI advisor)`,
      genderTag: genderTag
    }
  : portraitEngine.assignPortrait(
      genderPref,
      advisor.id,
      generatedName.firstName,
      generatedName.lastName
    );
```

### 2. Fixed AIAdvisorCard Name Logic
**Before**:
```typescript
const generatedName: GeneratedName = nameFactory.generateName(
  boardId,
  advisor.id,
  slotIndex,
  genderTag
);
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Use advisor.name if available, otherwise generate a name
const generatedName: GeneratedName = advisor.name 
  ? {
      firstName: advisor.name.split(' ')[0] || advisor.name,
      lastName: advisor.name.split(' ').slice(1).join(' ') || '',
      fullName: advisor.name,
      gender: genderTag
    }
  : nameFactory.generateName(
      boardId,
      advisor.id,
      slotIndex,
      genderTag
    );
```

## Result âœ…

Now each advisor will display their unique portrait as defined in the board specifications:

- **Dr. Lisa Thompson** â†’ `/Portraits/a2_safety-md.png` (feminine, reused)
- **Dr. Maria Garcia** â†’ `/Portraits/a5_pedagogy-mentor.png` (feminine, reused)

### EduBoard & RemediBoard
- Each advisor gets their assigned unique portrait

## Technical Details

- **Backward Compatibility**: The fix maintains backward compatibility - if no `advisor.avatar` is provided, it falls back to the portrait assignment engine
- **Performance**: No performance impact - just a simple conditional check
- **Flexibility**: Allows for both custom avatars (from board definitions) and generated avatars (from portrait registry)

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to any board selection
2. Each advisor should now show their unique portrait
3. No more duplicate/same avatars across different advisors
4. Portraits should match the assignments in `src/lib/boards.ts`

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/advisors/AIAdvisorCard.tsx` - Fixed portrait and name logic
2. `src/lib/boards.ts` - Updated all board definitions with unique portraits (done previously)

The avatar portrait issue is now **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**! ðŸŽ‰
