Based on my experience as ${persona.role} with expertise in ${persona.expertiseAreas.join(', ')}, I recommend focusing on these key areas:

1. **Strategic Approach**: Drawing from my background in ${persona.roleContext.split('.')[0]}, the first priority should be understanding the core objectives and constraints.

2. **Framework Application**: I'd apply the ${persona.frameworks[0]} framework to structure our thinking and ensure we're addressing all critical dimensions.

3. **Implementation Considerations**: From my practical experience, the key success factors include proper planning, stakeholder alignment, and measurable outcomes.

4. **Risk Mitigation**: Based on similar challenges I've encountered, the main risks to watch for are ${domainContext.risks}.

This approach leverages proven methodologies from my experience while being tailored to your specific context and requirements.`;
