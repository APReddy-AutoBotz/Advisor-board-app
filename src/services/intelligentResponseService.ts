**Millets (Recommended):**
- Lower glycemic index (35-55) vs white rice (70+)
- Higher fiber content helps slow glucose absorption
- Rich in magnesium, which supports insulin sensitivity
- Contains complex carbohydrates for sustained energy

**Rice Considerations:**
- Brown rice is better than white rice (GI ~50 vs 70+)
- Portion control is crucial with any rice variety
- Basmati rice has a lower GI than other white rice varieties

**My Naturopathic Recommendation:**
Start with small portions of millets (finger millet, pearl millet, or foxtail millet) and monitor blood glucose response. Combine with protein and healthy fats to further stabilize blood sugar. Consider soaking millets overnight for better digestibility.

**Important:** Always consult with your healthcare provider before making significant dietary changes, especially if you're on diabetes medications.`;

I'd need more specific information about your health goals and current situation to provide targeted recommendations. Would you like to discuss any particular health concerns?`;
