**Foundational Dietary Strategy:**
1. **Low Glycemic Index Focus**: Emphasize foods with GI <55 - steel-cut oats, quinoa, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables. Avoid refined carbohydrates and processed foods.

2. **Nutrient-Dense Whole Foods**: Include chromium-rich foods (broccoli, whole grains), magnesium sources (leafy greens, nuts), and omega-3 fatty acids (wild-caught fish, flaxseeds).

3. **Meal Timing & Portion Control**: Implement intermittent fasting (12-16 hours) and smaller, frequent meals to stabilize blood sugar. Use the plate method: 50% non-starchy vegetables, 25% lean protein, 25% complex carbohydrates.

**Natural Blood Sugar Support:**
- Bitter melon extract (500mg 2x daily)
- Cinnamon bark (1-2g daily) for insulin sensitivity
- Alpha-lipoic acid (300-600mg daily) for glucose metabolism
- Berberine (500mg 3x daily) - as effective as metformin in studies

**Lifestyle Integration:**
- Regular moderate exercise (30 minutes post-meal walking)
- Stress management through meditation or yoga
- Adequate sleep (7-9 hours) for hormonal balance

This approach addresses root causes while supporting conventional treatment. Always coordinate with your primary care physician for medication adjustments.`;

2. **Personalized Treatment Protocols**: Every patient is unique. I develop individualized treatment plans combining herbal medicine, nutritional therapy, and lifestyle modifications based on your specific constitution and health history.

3. **Evidence-Based Natural Therapies**: I integrate traditional naturopathic wisdom with modern research. For conditions like diabetes, I use proven approaches like chromium supplementation, bitter melon extract, and targeted dietary interventions.

4. **Holistic Lifestyle Integration**: True healing requires addressing all aspects of health - nutrition, movement, stress management, sleep optimization, and emotional well-being.

5. **Collaborative Care Approach**: I work alongside conventional medical providers to ensure safe, comprehensive care that maximizes therapeutic outcomes while minimizing risks.

**TCM Pattern Assessment:**
Most diabetic patients show patterns of:
- Kidney Yin deficiency (frequent urination, thirst)
- Spleen Qi deficiency (poor digestion, fatigue)
- Stomach Heat (excessive hunger, dry mouth)

**Dietary Therapy (È£üÁñó) Recommendations:**
1. **Cooling, Nourishing Foods**: Bitter melon (Ëã¶Áìú), winter melon, mung beans, and mulberry leaves to clear Heat and nourish Yin
2. **Spleen-Supporting Grains**: Job's tears (ËñèÁ±≥), millet, and small amounts of brown rice to strengthen digestive function
3. **Kidney-Nourishing Foods**: Black sesame seeds, walnuts, goji berries, and Chinese yam to support Kidney Yin

**Herbal Formula Considerations:**
- Yu Quan Wan (ÁéâÊ≥â‰∏∏) for Kidney Yin deficiency patterns
- Gan Lu Yin (ÁîòÈú≤È•Æ) for Stomach Heat with Yin deficiency
- Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (ÂÖ≠Âë≥Âú∞ÈªÑ‰∏∏) for foundational Kidney support

**Lifestyle Harmony:**
- Gentle Qigong exercises like "Eight Pieces of Brocade"
- Meditation to calm Shen (spirit) and reduce stress
- Regular sleep schedule (9 PM - 6 AM) to support Kidney function

**Acupuncture Points**: Zusanli (ST36), Sanyinjiao (SP6), and Taixi (KI3) for metabolic regulation.

This integrative approach balances your constitution while supporting blood sugar stability. Work with both TCM and conventional practitioners for optimal care.`;
      }
      
      return `${template} From my Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective, bridging ancient wisdom with modern research, I approach your question about "${question}" through TCM principles:

1. **Constitutional Assessment**: In TCM, we first assess your unique constitution (‰ΩìË¥®) - whether you tend toward heat or cold, excess or deficiency patterns. This guides all treatment decisions.

2. **Pattern Differentiation (Ëæ®ËØÅËÆ∫Ê≤ª)**: Rather than treating diseases, we treat patterns of disharmony. For diabetes (Ê∂àÊ∏¥Áóá), we might see patterns of Kidney Yin deficiency, Spleen Qi deficiency, or Heat in the Stomach.

3. **Multi-Modal Treatment Approach**: I combine acupuncture, Chinese herbal formulas, dietary therapy (È£üÁñó), and Qigong exercises for comprehensive healing that addresses both symptoms and root causes.

4. **Seasonal and Lifestyle Harmony**: TCM emphasizes living in harmony with natural cycles. Treatment plans include seasonal dietary adjustments, appropriate exercise, and stress management techniques.

5. **Gradual, Sustainable Healing**: TCM focuses on gentle, sustained improvement that strengthens the body's natural healing capacity rather than forcing rapid changes.

Core TCM frameworks I utilize: Five Element Theory for understanding organ relationships, Yin-Yang balance for treatment planning, and Qi and Blood theory for addressing energy and circulation patterns.`;
