# How We Used Kiro
- **Spec-to-code**: scaffolded Vite + React + TS + Tailwind using Kiro specs.
- **Vibe coding**: micro-interactions (shimmer, stagger, glass), a11y focus rings.
- **Steering**: system prompts - verdict-first, ≤12-word bullets, board-safe disclaimers.
- **Hooks**: build/deploy automation + persona safety checks.
- **Why Kiro**: faster iteration, consistent UX, safer domain-locked outputs.
## Most impressive gen
- Multi-board advisory flow + persona lenses scaffold with minimal edits.
- Premium hero + sticky demo rail with analytics hooks.
## Repo notes
- /.kiro includes specs/vibes/steering (required for judging).
- Netlify function proxies OpenAI; no client-side secrets.
